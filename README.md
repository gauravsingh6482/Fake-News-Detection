Fake News Detection

Fake News is any news that is either factually wrong, misrepresents the facts, and that spreads virally (or maybe to a targeted audience). It can be spread both through regular news mediums or on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.

What truly differentiates Fake News from simple hoaxes like “Moon landing was fake”, etc. is the fact that it carefully mimics the “style” and “patterns” that real news usually follows. That’s what makes it so hard to distinguish for the untrained human eye.

Additionally, it is interesting to note that Fake News has been around for a long, long time (throughout our history, actually).
